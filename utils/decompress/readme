The log files produced by the simulator are automatically compressed with zlib. If you need to read the contents of the files, use this program.
running "./decompress inputFile outputFile" will store in outputFile the decompressed contents of inputFile.

UPDATE: log files are now just dumps of the binary arrays into memory (for speed reasons), 
so for new simulations you will need to use "./toASCII inputFile outputFile" if you want to read the contents. 
If you are human, that is. Otherwise, just enjoy the binary.
