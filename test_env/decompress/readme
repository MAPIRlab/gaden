The log files produced by the simulator are automatically compressed with zlib. If you need to read the contents of the files, use this program.
running "./decompress inputFile outputFile" will store in outputFile the decompressed contents of inputFile.

UPDATE: log files are now just dumps of the binary arrays into memory (for speed reasons), 
so for new simulations you will need to use "./toASCII inputFile outputFile" if you want to read the contents. 
If you are human, that is. Otherwise, just enjoy the binary.

If for some reason you need to recompile the source code, do "g++ src/<file> -lboost_iostreams"...

or else...!
